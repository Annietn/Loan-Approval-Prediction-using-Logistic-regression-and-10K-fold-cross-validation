# Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-Logistic-regression-and-10K-fold-cross-validation
With the dramatic growth on the banking sector, banks have received unlimited applications for loans. Making decisions on eligible applicants to a loan plays a key role in banking process. In this project, I will use Logistic Regression Model and 10-fold cross validation to predict the factors that affect a bank's decision to grant a loan.
